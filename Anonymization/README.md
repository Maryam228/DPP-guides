# Section Title
De-identification: Any data processing activities or methods that work to prevent a Data Subject’s identity from being revealed. Example types: Anonymization and Pseudonymization

Anonymization: The process by which Personal Data is rendered anonymous, such that a Data Subject is no longer identifiable. Common methods include removing certain amounts of Personal Data, or applying a range of values across certain sets of Personal Data.

Pseudonymization: the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
---
Anonymization is a process by which personal data is irreversibly altered, either by removing or modifying the identifying variables, in such a way that a data subject can no longer be identified directly or indirectly.

Pseudonymization takes personal data and ensures that it can’t be linked back to one source or single user without additional data. For instance, if a company has your name, email address, age, nationality, and workplace name, pseudonymization takes the data that’s identifiable about you specifically (your name, age, etc.) and makes it inaccessible and separate from non-identifying data, like your nationality. Pseudonymous data *can* be put back together at some point so that all information can be taken together and linked back to a specific source or person.

## Importance
Reasons why particular security advice is given: e.g. “don’t re-use passwords because lists of passwords available on the internet make it easy for someone to get into more than one of your accounts.”

## Principles
"As covered in Tipsheet 3, Data Minimization is a core principle of responsible data management. One way to minimize the amount of personal or sensitive data that you are holding is to de-identify it. In other words, to remove identifying information so that the data becomes ‘anonymous’. When data is anonymized or de-identified, the association between data and the individuals to which it relates is removed so that an individual cannot be identified in the data. This is done by removing both ‘direct identifiers’ and ‘indirect identifiers’, for example, by removing a national ID number or a birthdate. This process makes the data more private and puts people at less risk because it has been scrubbed of identifying information or aggregated to a level where individuals cannot be identified.

It’s important to remember that even de-identified or aggregated data can put entire groups of people at risk – for example, if the location of particular ethnic or religious groups could be used to attack those groups. If information is released about where a CVA distribution is going to happen or has happened, this could result in unwanted groups interfering with or harming individuals who are receiving CVA or organizations that are providing it. Besides firstly planning how to anonymize or de-identify individual data, you will need to also consider how to protect non-personal data. Certain data should only be shared or released to those who need it for approved purposes and in suitably protected data environments with appropriate technical and organizational controls. Because technology and data analytics is becoming ever more sophisticated, you will likely need support from your data or IT team for data de-identification." **These 2 paragraphs from Linda**

Advantages of using anonymized data where appropriate over personal
data include:
- it protects against inappropriate disclosure of personal data;
fewer legal restrictions apply.
- it can be easier to use anonymised data in new and different
ways because the DPA’s purpose limitation rules do not apply;
- it allows organisations to make information public while still
complying with their data protection obligations; and
- the disclosure of anonymised data is not a disclosure of personal data – even where the data controller holds the key to allow reidentification to take place.
