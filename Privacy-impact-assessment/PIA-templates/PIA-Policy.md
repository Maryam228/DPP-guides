## Final assessment and recommendations
After reviewing the above and reflecting on your answers, how will you proceed?

- [ ] The risks and harms are not likely, and if they are, they would not be severe. Moreover, the benefits outweigh these risks. I will proceed with the project.
- [ ] The risks and harms are more severe than the potential benefit of the project. However, I can mitigate the risks and proceed with the project.
- [ ] The risks and harms are more severe than the potential benefit of the project.
- [ ] The risks cannot be mitigated. I will cancel the project.
- [ ] I do not know. I need more guidance from domain and data experts (legal, privacy, security, etc.).
