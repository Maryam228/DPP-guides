## Importance **need to clear this copy**
A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is a systematic analysis of the potential privacy risks related to data collected during program implementation. A PIA analyzes threats and risks to program data, including any legal and environmental factors, and develops mitigation strategies. PIAs help humanitarians protect participants’ privacy and strengthen public confidence in the program.
