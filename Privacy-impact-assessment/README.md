# Privacy Impact Assessments
This section will help you understand a Privacy Impact Assessment (or "PIA") and contains the PIA template used at Mercy Corps.

## Importance
A Privacy Impact Assessment allows you to analyze how a particular project or new technology will affect the privacy of the individuals involved. A PIA form contains a series of questions that create a framework for identifying the potential privacy risks related to data collection and management that are part of implementing a new program or technology. A PIA also helps to document mitigation strategies that protect participant's privacy and strengthen public confidence in our work.

## Principles
The principles behind a PIA are similar to those for any secure use of personal data. As outlined by the  [Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP)](https://www.calpnetwork.org/publication/protecting-beneficiary-privacy-principles-and-operational-standards-for-the-secure-use-of-personal-data-in-cash-and-e-transfer-programmes/) these principles are:

- Identify the privacy risks to individuals
- Identify the privacy and data protection compliance liabilities for the organization
- Protect the organizationâ€™s reputation and instill public confidence in the program
- Ensure that the organization is promoting human rights in its humanitarian activities

## Instructions or Guidance
This section includes a guidance video to walk you through the Mercy Corps PIA.

In general, a PIA will require the following steps:
1. Identify the need for a PIA.
2. Describe how data are collected, from whom, and for what purpose.
3. Identify any privacy risks.
4. Document mitigation strategies or actions to eliminate or minimize these risks.
5. Sign off and record the PIA outcomes.

Remember that:
- A PIA is a _process_ used to identify and minimize the privacy risks. Completing a PIA form is not the end of the process! Revisit the form at regular intervals (e.g. six months) to make sure there are no new changes to a project that introduces new risks. If there are, go through the process of documenting mitigation strategies again to minimize any new risk.
- Conducting a PIA involves working with people at Mercy Corps, but also with partner organizations and others to identify and reduce privacy risks. For example, if you are using a new technology, you may need to research whether the company you are working with has a privacy policy and what technological safeguards they use to ensure data are protected. You may also need to educate yourself about relevant privacy regulations in your country of operation.
- A PIA will help to ensure that potential problems are identified at an early stage, when addressing them will often be simpler, less costly, and will not risk harming program participants or staff. We recommend creating an action list to ensure that each action required to ensure data protection and privacy has an owner and will get completed.
- It can be helpful to compare PIAs of similar programs. You can conduct this research on your own or reach out to the Data Protection and Privacy team for assistance.
