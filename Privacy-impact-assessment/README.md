# Privacy Impact Assessments
This section will help you understand a Privacy Impact Assessment (or "PIA") and contains the PIA guidance and template used at Mercy Corps. The PIA template contains a series of questions that create a framework for identifying the potential privacy risks related to data collection and management that are part of implementing a new program or technology.

A PIA is required anytime an activity involves the collection or use of personal or sensitive data.

## Importance
A PIA allows you to analyze how a particular project or new technology will affect the privacy of the individuals involved. A PIA also helps to document mitigation strategies that protect participant's privacy and strengthen public confidence in our work. A PIA ensures that potential problems are identified early on, when addressing them will be simpler, less costly, and not risk harming program participants or staff.

## Principles
The principles behind a PIA are similar to those for any secure use of personal data. As outlined by the  [Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP)](https://www.calpnetwork.org/publication/protecting-beneficiary-privacy-principles-and-operational-standards-for-the-secure-use-of-personal-data-in-cash-and-e-transfer-programmes/) these principles are:

- Identify the privacy risks to individuals.
- Identify the privacy and data protection compliance liabilities for your organization.
- Protect the organization’s reputation and instill public confidence in the program.
- Ensure that the organization is promoting human rights in its humanitarian activities.

## Guidance
You can find Mercy Corps' [PIA Guidance here in the Digital Library](https://library.mercycorps.org/record/34302). The document contains answers to frequently asked questions related to PIA and links to the internal Mercy Corps archive of completed PIA for comparison.

Remember that:
- A PIA is a _process_ used to identify and minimize the privacy risks. Completing a PIA form is not the end of the process! Revisit the form again after your project starts to make sure there are no new changes to a project that introduce new risks. If there are, go through the process of documenting mitigation strategies again to minimize any new risk.
- Conducting a PIA involves working with people at Mercy Corps, but also with partner organizations and others to identify and reduce privacy risks. For example, if you are using a new technology, you may need to research whether the company you are working with has a privacy policy and what technological safeguards they use to ensure data are protected. You may also need to educate yourself about relevant privacy regulations in your country of operation.
- It can be helpful to compare PIAs of similar programs. You can conduct this research on your own or reach out to the Data Protection and Privacy team for assistance.

## Templates
You can find the complete Mercy Corps' [PIA Template here in the Digital Library](https://library.mercycorps.org/record/34316).

For ease of use, there are also 5 templates that for specific use-cases. Clicking the link below will take you to a screen where you can download the document in the `.odt` format (compatible with Microsoft Word and open source applications like OpenOffice and LibreOffice) by clicking `View raw` or the `Download` button:
- a new **[Policy](PIA-templates/PIA-New-Policy-open.odt)**
- a new **[Process or Procedure](PIA-templates/PIA-New-Process-procedure.odt)**
- a new **[Software or Technology System](PIA-templates/PIA-New-Software-Technology-system.odt)**
  - This is primarily for implementation of new global, country-wide or team-specific systems.
  - If you are selecting or using a new system as part of a larger project or program, use the project or program option instead.
- a new **[Vendor or Partner](PIA-templates/PIA-New-Vendor-Partner.odt)**
  - This is primarily meant for validation of a vendor, partner, or third party’s activities as part of a unique or one-time activity.
  - If you are selecting or using a new vendor, partner or third party as part of a larger project or program, use the project or program option instead.
- a new **[Project or Program](PIA-templates/PIA-New-Project-Program.odt)**
  - This can be for any phase or aspect of a project or program.
  - *This is the most comprehensive PIA option*, and includes language for also selecting new software or tech systems, and/or a new vendor or partner.

## Further Assistance
- The Electronic Cash Transfer Learning Action Network's [Data Starter Kit](https://www.calpnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DataStarterKitforFieldStaffELAN.pdf) provides a tip sheet for PIAs (see Tip sheet #1).
- The Information Commissioner's Office of the UK provides [a detailed code of practice for conducing privacy impact assessments](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/consultations/2052/draft-conducting-privacy-impact-assessments-code-of-practice.pdf).
- The International Committee of the Red Cross' [*Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action*](https://www.icrc.org/en/data-protection-humanitarian-action-handbook) is a detailed guide to almost every aspect of humanitarian data. Chapter 5 specifically deals with privacy impact assessments.
