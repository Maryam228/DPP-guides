# Section Title
This section addresses a basic use-case for encrypting a file. First, it's important to understand a few basic points:
- There is a difference between "password protection" and "encryption."
- diff b/t "At rest" and "in transit"
- encryption laws.

*What's the difference between password protection and encryption?*
Think of password protection as a box with a lock on it. When you "password protection" your document you are putting it in an electronic box and locking it: only those with the password can open the box. However, if the password you choose is not very strong, or if it is shared indiscriminantly, someone can easily get into the box and view your document! By contrast, encryption uses complex algorithms to encode information, which requires having a key to decrypt it. Think of this as taking your document and running it through a paper shredder that assigns a special key to put the document back together again. When you combine password protection and encryption, you are effectively doubling your protection. If someone successfully breaks the password to the electronic box, they will only be able to see the bits of shredded paper without also having the proper key. All Mercy Corps' laptops are encrypted using Microsoft BitLocker. This prevents a Mercy Corps laptop hard disks from being removed and accessed on another computer.

*What does it mean to protect data "at rest" and "in transit"?*
Data "at rest" is data that is stored somewhere: on a mobile device, laptop, server, or external hard drive, for example. When data is at rest, it is not moving from one place to another. Data "in transit" is information that is moving over a network from one place to another, such as sending an email.

## Importance
Encryption is important because it helps ensure the privacy and security of information. Without encryption, data can be intercepted and read by anyone who has access to it. When considering whether or not to encrypt data, ask yourself, "What is the risk to Mercy Corps' program participants, staff, and partners if these data were lost of stolen?" A good rule of thumb is to encrypt anything containing personally identifiable or sensitive information.

## Principles
"Use vetted organizational systems for encrypted data transfer and storage (for example, Microsoft SharePoint for file transfer instead of third-party file-sharing programs)." - from Linda
