# File Sharing Best Practices: Gsuite
This section will cover file sharing best practices for Mercy Corps team members using G Suite apps, particularly Gmail and Google My Drive. To simplify this guide, we will be discussing sharing a single *file*, such as a spreadsheet. However, the same options are available when sharing a My Drive *folder*.

## Importance
There are several reasons why it is better to share a file by hosting it in Google Drive and sending a link rather than as an attachment in an email.
- **Security**: you can easily change who is permitted to access or edit your file. You can also make the link time sensitive by only allowing access to the file for a given period of time.
- **Version control**: when sharing a file that is hosted online, many people can access it at once and all changes and comments will stay in one file. Sending a file as an attachment often results in multiple versions of the same document with different file names, edits, comments, etc. The document owner will spend a lot of time trying to compile all of this into a single file! Using a link also guarantees that the recipients always have access to the most updated version of the document.
- **File sizes**: Some IT departments impose restrictions on the size of attachment that are allowed. Sending a link allows you to share files of any size.
- **Easy editing**: Files shared as Google documents in Drive, Microsoft Word in OneDrive, or similar formats allow the recipient to open and interact with the document using a web browser: they do not have to have the most recent version of a particular type of software.

## Principles
Whenever you share documents, you should consider the following:
- Only give access to those who need the file. When you share a file in My Drive, the default setting is `Restricted` (to persons or groups),
and that is the best practice.
- Confidential, private or personally identifiable information (PII) content should *always* have restricted access. Note: if you are unable to determine if or how the content should be restricted, please seek assistance from Legal or the Responsible Data team.
 - The `Anyone with the link` option should only be used for files that hold no confidential information, and are open to the public. If the `Anyone with the link` setting was used on a file with confidential private, personal or financial data, it could put Mercy Corps at
immediate legal risk, and make it easy for bad actors to use that information for criminal purposes.
- Identify and apply the appropriate level of editing permissions
 - Example: a new project charter needs to be created. It’s likely only the team responsible for charter creation should have `Editor` access.
 - When it’s time to get feedback from others, grant `Viewer` or `Commenter` permission to those individuals, based on the level of interaction you expect or need.
 - To learn more about access levels, visit [Share and collaborate in My Drive](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310248?hl=en). You can also restrict the ability for others to download a file, or share it with others. To learn more, visit [Restrict sharing options on Drive](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308868?hl=en).
- Identify risks and secure accordingly
 - Active collaboration should happen in Drive. If your content will be actively edited or have multiple versions over time, the best place for your file is usually Google Drive. If your content will contain sensitive information, this should be stored on Mercy Corps secure servers, when this option is available. By contrast, finished documents that are intended for use outside your team should be uploaded in the Digital Library.
 - If your project requires the use of applications outside of G Suite, encourage your team to download [Google Drive for desktop](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379?hl=en). This program allows you to view any documents in My Drive or Shared drives as if they were on your laptop, even when offline, and without having to download the item or convert it to a Google format.
- Permissions change over time
 - If you are only working with someone for a short period of time or with people outside Mercy Corps, consider giving temporary permissions, by adding an expiration date to their access. If you forget to remove the access later, an expiration date will ensure their access is suspended at the right time.
 - You may also want to consider restricting whether people have the ability to edit permissions on the file, or be able to download, print or copy the file.
 - It is a best practice to periodically audit the list of who has access to your files, folders or Shared drives. A regular review of file/folder permissions will ensure you remove access for team members who have changed roles, or are no longer with Mercy Corps.

## Further Assistance
This document will not cover file sharing in Google’s shared drives, nor external file sharing platforms. To learn more about these, visit Google’s [Best practices for shared drives](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310352?hl=en) or [managing shared drives page](https://support.google.com/a/topic/7337266?hl=en&ref_topic=2490075). Each of these pages is available in a variety of languages: scroll to the bottom of the page to select your language.

The best way to control access to files using Drive is to create a Google group and assign permissions to those in the group. Google groups are not just for sending emails; groups are powerful and convenient tools for managing folder and file permissions.
