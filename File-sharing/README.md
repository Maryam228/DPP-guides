# File Sharing Best Practices: Gsuite
This section will cover file sharing best practices for Mercy Corps team members using G Suite apps, particularly Gmail and Google My Drive. To simplify this guide, we will be discussing sharing a single *file*, such as a spreadsheet. However, the same options are available when sharing a My Drive *folder*. This document will not cover file sharing in Google’s shared drives, nor external file sharing platforms. To learn more about these, visit Google’s [Best practices for shared drives](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310352?hl=en) or [managing shared drives page](https://support.google.com/a/topic/7337266?hl=en&ref_topic=2490075). Each of these pages is available in a variety of languages: scroll to the bottom of the page to select your language.
