# File Sharing: GDrive
Here is a sample use-case for sharing a file, using best practices in Gdrive. Imagine that Mercy Corps is working with a consultant (PNW Rocks), to create materials for a major new initiative at Mercy Corps, code-named Big Cheese. The Big Cheese project will not be announced publicly until July 2021. It is time to collaborate on next steps for the project, in a file called Big Cheese Plans.

## Step 1 - Upload
Upload the file to My Drive.

## Step 3 - Select level of access
Enter the email address address for the person you want to share with, then choose the level of access. Google defaults to `Editor` access, but you can also choose `Viewer` or `Commenter`, if contributions should be limited. Best practice is to notify the person, and add a message, explaining why you’ve shared the file. To notify, leave that box checked. When done with changes, click `Send`.

Another option is to send a separate email with a link to the file. To notify separately via email, uncheck the `Notify people` box. After clicking `Done`,  right click the file and choose `Get Link`. In the new popup window, click the `Copy link` button, and paste it into your email.

## Step 4 - Temporary Access
Once permission has been granted, the sharing time period can be shortened. To limit access, right click the file again, and click `Share`. Find the email address you just shared with and right click the access level. You will see new options appear, so click on `Give temporary access`.

A calendar will appear. Navigate to the month when access should expire, and click the corresponding date.

The calendar will disappear, and the display date will change. Once you can see that access will expire on the correct date, click Save.

## Step 5 - Additional Options
If you have concerns about others taking inappropriate actions with the content, there are additional options from the settings screen. File settings can be accessed from the gear icon in the upper right of the sharing window. Click the gear and you’ll see options to restrict further sharing, or disabling the option to download, print or copy. For any feature you want to disable, simply uncheck the box. The file will quickly update, saving the new setting.

The best way to control access to files using Drive is to create a Google group and assign permissions to those in the group. Google groups are not just for sending emails; groups are powerful and convenient tools for managing folder and file permissions. [Find out more about Google Groups here](https://support.google.com/groups/?hl=en#topic=9216).

If your project requires the use of applications outside of G Suite, encourage your team to download [Google Drive for desktop](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379?hl=en). This program allows you to view any documents in My Drive or Shared drives as if they were on your laptop, even when offline, and without having to download the item or convert it to a Google format.
