# Data Protection & Privacy Guide
This guide is designed to help Mercy Corps staff better understand and implement responsible data practices. It brings together several existing Mercy Corps policies and guidance documents together with some simple tutorials and links to other resources. The guide is composed of the following sections:

- **Sensitive data** - will help you understand what sensitive data is and provide guidance for its collection and use.
- **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** - provides details regarding PIA and the assessment templates required by Mercy Corps Responsible Data policy
- **Deidentification** - contains an overview of deidentification - including anonymization and pseudonymization - and an example or one way to deidentify a dataset using spreadsheet software.
- **Encryption** - provides an brief overview of encryption and provides an example or one way to encrypt a file using software available within Mercy Corps.
- **File sharing** - presents an overview of best practices using Gsuite at Mercy Corps and a brief tutorial.

While the guide is primarily intended for Mercy Corps staff, and is designed to accompany the [Responsible Data Toolkit](https://www.mercycorps.org/research-resources/responsible-data-toolkit) we are releasing it under open license in the hopes that it may be beneficial to partners, peer-organizations, and others in need of example policies, templates, and instructions for implementing responsible data practices.
