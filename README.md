The content provided in this guide is all part of good data management practices and the larger "data life cycle," or the overall activities for individual data collection as part of a program or response. The following resources are excellent places to start for a more complete understanding of managing your data responsibly. We have used or cited portions of all of these resources throughout the Guide and refer to specific chapters or sections as part of each section.

- The [Cash Learning Partnership's *Data Responsibility Toolkit*](https://www.calpnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Data-Responsibility-Toolkit_A-guide-for-Cash-and-Voucher-Practitioners.pdf) is designed for cash and voucher practitioners specifically, but is a "gold standard" in guidance for responsible data. The Toolkit is also available in [Arabic](https://www.calpnetwork.org/ar/publication/data-responsibility-toolkit-a-guide-for-cva-practitioners/); [French](https://www.calpnetwork.org/fr/publication/data-responsibility-toolkit-a-guide-for-cva-practitioners/); and [Spanish](https://www.calpnetwork.org/fr/publication/data-responsibility-toolkit-a-guide-for-cva-practitioners/).

- The Humanitarian Data Centre's [online tutorial for conducting a disclosure risk assessment](https://centre.humdata.org/learning-path/disclosure-risk-assessment-overview/) is a very specific, technical resource, but one that is indispensable for truly reducing the risk of data being used to identify individuals.
